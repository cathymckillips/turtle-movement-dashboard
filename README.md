# 🐢 Turtle Movement Dashboard

Welcome to the Turtle Movement Dashboard—a Power BI project inspired by six years of real-world observation of Eastern Box Turtles living in my backyard garden sanctuary.

## 📖 Project Overview

This interactive dashboard tracks the daily movement patterns of six turtles between May and July 2025. It was created to visualize how environmental factors and age influence their activity, offering insights into behavioral trends in a natural setting.

## 🐢 The Story Behind the Data

Over the past six years, our garden has quietly become a seasonal refuge for Eastern Box Turtles. From hatchlings to adults, each turtle brings its own rhythm and personality to the space. Inspired by this, I began to document their appearances, noticing that younger turtles like JJ had more consistent movement schedules, while older turtles varied based on weather or instinct.

This project blends personal observation with technical skill—bringing a unique story to life through data.

## 📊 Features

- **Turtle Movement Tracking** – Days each turtle was observed outside
